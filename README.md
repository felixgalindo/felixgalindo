# 👋 Hi, I'm Felix Galindo  

**Principal Engineer @ Digi International | Edge AI + IoT Strategist | Building intelligent systems at the edge**  

I specialize in **embedded systems, Edge AI, and intelligent IoT infrastructure**.  
My focus is on designing systems that bridge low-level hardware with high-impact AI use cases, bringing intelligence closer to where data is generated.

## 🔧 Currently
- Leading **Edge AI initiatives at Digi International**, architecting IoT systems that process data at the source for smarter, faster decision-making
- Building [TinyMLDelta](https://github.com/felixgalindo/TinyMLDelta) - an incremental model update system for TinyML and edge devices.

- Building [toyvision-ai](https://github.com/felixgalindo/toyvision-ai) – an open-source project to teach kids about AI through playful experiments  
- Architecting a modern [C library for XBee](https://github.com/felixgalindo/xbee_c_library), enabling developers to integrate Digi’s wireless IoT with ease
