# Hi, I'm Felix Galindo

Principal Engineer @ Digi International | Edge AI & IoT Strategist  
Building intelligent systems at the edge

I specialize in embedded systems, Edge AI, and intelligent IoT infrastructure.  
My work focuses on bridging low-level hardware with scalable, production-ready AI platforms, bringing intelligence closer to where data is generated and acted upon.
