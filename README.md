# 👋 Hi, I'm Felix Galindo  

**Principal Engineer @ Digi International | Edge AI + IoT Strategist | Building intelligent systems at the edge**  

I specialize in **embedded systems, Edge AI, and intelligent IoT infrastructure**.  
My focus is on designing systems that bridge low-level hardware with high-impact AI use cases, bringing intelligence closer to where data is generated.
